\section{What is a System?}
A system is an organized set of components working together in order to achieve a specific goal or perform a particular function. Systems can be biological, mechanical, social, or information systems. For example, a computer is a system made up of hardware (like the processor, memory, and storage) and software (like the operating system and applications). Each part of the system contributes to the overall function, such as running programs or storing data. Similarly, in an organization, a system could be the combination of people, processes, and technology that work together to manage operations like sales, customer service, or logistics.

Thus, we can say, a system is a collection of interrelated components or elements that work together to achieve a common goal.

\section{What is a Subsystem?}
A well-designed system comprises multiple subsystems to effectively distribute the workflow. Each subsystem is tailored to achieve specific sub-goals that ultimately contribute to the attainment of the common goal. For example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Central Processing Unit (CPU) Subsystem:} Acts as the brain of the system, executing instructions and processing data. Its efficiency directly impacts the overall performance of the system.
    \item \textbf{Memory Subsystem:} Provides temporary storage for data and instructions that are actively being used. Efficient memory management helps in quick data retrieval and smooth operation of applications.
    \item \textbf{Storage Subsystem:} Ensures long-term data retention. Choosing between HDDs and SSDs depends on the need for speed versus storage capacity and cost.
    \item \textbf{Input/Output (I/O) Subsystem:} Facilitates communication between the computer and external devices. A well-designed I/O subsystem improves user interaction and data transfer rates.
    \item \textbf{Power Supply Subsystem:} Delivers the necessary electrical power to all components. Reliable power supply is crucial for maintaining system stability and preventing hardware failures.
\end{itemize}

Each subsystem operates independently but must work in harmony with the others to achieve optimal performance and reliability of the entire system.

\section{What is a Bad System?}
A bad system can be identified by several issues that undermine its effectiveness, reliability, or user experience. Here are some common traits of a bad system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Poor Performance:} The system is slow, unresponsive, or struggles to handle tasks efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Unreliable:} The system frequently crashes, encounters errors, or has unstable performance.
    \item \textbf{Complex or Confusing:} The system is difficult to use, with a confusing interface or complicated processes.
    \item \textbf{Inadequate Security:} The system lacks proper security measures, making it vulnerable to attacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access.
    \item \textbf{Poor Scalability:} The system cannot handle increased loads or scale effectively as demands grow.
    \item \textbf{High Maintenance Costs:} The system requires frequent repairs, updates, or manual interventions.
    \item \textbf{Incompatibility:} The system has trouble integrating with other systems or technologies.
    \item \textbf{Lack of Documentation:} The system is poorly documented, making it difficult for users or administrators to understand or troubleshoot issues.
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Resource Use:} The system consumes excessive resources (such as memory, CPU, or storage) without providing corresponding benefits, leading to wasted resources and increased operational costs.
\end{itemize}

In summary, a bad system fails to meet its intended goals effectively, and if any of the subsystems fail or operate poorly, the entire system becomes inefficient or bad.

\section{Explain the Following Software Development Methodologies}

\subsection{a. Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) – Systematic Approach}
\textbf{Explanation:} The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured, step-by-step approach for developing software. It follows a series of stages from understanding what the system needs to do, through designing, building, testing, and finally deploying the software. It is often described as a "waterfall" model because each phase flows into the next in a linear fashion.

\textbf{Stages:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Planning:} Identify the system's needs and define the project scope.
    \item \textbf{Analysis:} Gather detailed requirements and understand how the system should function.
    \item \textbf{Design:} Create the architecture and design of the system.
    \item \textbf{Implementation:} Build and code the software.
    \item \textbf{Testing:} Check the software for bugs and ensure it works as intended.
    \item \textbf{Deployment:} Install the software in the real-world environment.
    \item \textbf{Maintenance:} Update and fix the system as needed over time.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Key Point:} SDLC is a systematic and organized way of developing software, ensuring that all steps are followed to create a reliable and effective system.

\subsection{b. The Agile Approach}
\textbf{Explanation:} The Agile approach is a flexible and iterative method of software development. Unlike the linear approach of SDLC, Agile focuses on working in small, manageable chunks called "sprints" or "iterations." Each sprint usually lasts a few weeks and results in a small part of the software being developed and tested. Agile emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, and continuous feedback.

\textbf{Key Principles:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} The project can adapt to changes quickly, whether in requirements or project direction.
    \item \textbf{Customer Collaboration:} Regular feedback from the customers is crucial to ensure the software meets their needs.
    \item \textbf{Iterative Development:} The software is developed in smaller parts, with each part being tested and improved in cycles.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Point:} Agile is a more adaptive and collaborative approach to software development, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes and deliver working software frequently.

\subsection{c. Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design (OOSAD)}
\textbf{Explanation:} Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design (OOSAD) focuses on designing software using "objects". Objects are self-contained units that represent real-world entities or concepts, each with its own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOSAD uses these objects to model the system, making it easier to design, understand, and modify.

\textbf{Key Concepts:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Objects:} Represent real-world entities like a "Customer" or "Product" in a system.
    \item \textbf{Classes:} Blueprints for creating objects. For example, a "Car" class might define that all cars have wheels and engines.
    \item \textbf{Inheritance:} Allowing new objects to inherit properties and behaviors from existing ones, reducing redundancy.
    \item \textbf{Encapsulation:} Hiding the internal workings of an object, exposing only what is necessary.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discuss How You Would Select Each of Those Development Methodologies in Different Scenarios}

\subsection{a. Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) – Systematic Approach}
\textbf{When to Select:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Well-Defined Requirements:} Use SDLC when the project has clear and fixed requirements from the start. This approach is best for projects where everything needs to be planned out in advance.
    \item \textbf{Large and Complex Projects:} SDLC works well for large projects that need a structured and detailed process to manage complexity.
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance:} If the project involves strict regulations or standards, SDLC ensures that all necessary steps are documented and followed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Scenario:} Developing a government system where requirements are fixed, and there is a need for detailed documentation and a step-by-step process.

\subsection{b. The Agile Approach}
\textbf{When to Select:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Changing Requirements:} Choose Agile when the project is likely to have changing or evolving requirements. Agile’s flexibility allows for adjustments as the project progresses.
    \item \textbf{Fast-Paced Environment:} Agile is ideal for projects that need quick delivery of small, functional parts of the software. This approach is suitable when there is a need for regular updates and feedback.
    \item \textbf{Customer Involvement:} Agile is best when continuous customer interaction and feedback are necessary to shape the product.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Scenario:} Developing a mobile app where user feedback is crucial, and the product needs frequent updates based on that feedback.

\subsection{c. Object-Oriented Systems Analysis and Design (OOSAD)}
\textbf{When to Select:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Complex Data Relationships:} Use OOSAD when the system involves complex relationships between different entities (e.g., a customer database that links customers, orders, and products).
    \item \textbf{Reusability:} OOSAD is ideal when the project needs components that can be reused in other parts of the system or future projects. The object-oriented approach makes it easier to create modular, reusable code.
    \item \textbf{Long-Term Maintenance:} If the project requires easy maintenance and future updates, OOSAD’s structure helps by keeping the system modular and organized.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Scenario:} Designing a customer relationship management (CRM) system where customers, products, and orders are managed as separate objects, making the system easy to maintain and expand.
